/* 1.Use .filter() to extract all products that cost less than 200 <X>

2. Use .map() to make a list that only contain the product names

3. Use a chained combination of .filter() and .map() to list only
the names of all products in a specific category (e.g. 'electronics')

4. Use .some() to check if there are any products that cost more than 1000

5. Use .reduce() to find the total cost of all the products. */
